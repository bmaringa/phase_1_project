BUSINESS QUESTION
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

To get the results for the above business problem,I developed the following business questions:

1) How many genres are there in the movie industry.
      2) which are the possible genre_combination in the market,a reflection of the tastes demanded by the customers.
      3) How popular is each genre and how does each genre compare with each other in regard to popularity.
      4) Is the  cost of producing individual movie  directly related to  income generated.
      5) How are movies perfoming locally and internationally.

By answering the above questions,we shall establish various type of movies categoriesed by taste(genre) and establish genre popularity,types of movies categorised by cost and establish their market performance, and finally categories movie markets and establish market performance individually and comparativewise.
